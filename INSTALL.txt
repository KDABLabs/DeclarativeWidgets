The DeclarativeWidgets software uses Qt's qmake buildsystem.

To build this library you will need:
 - A C++11 compliant compiler
 - Qt5 built from the dev branch

Building on Unix with gcc:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% qmake -r ../declarativewidgets.pro
% make
% make install

Building on Windows with Microsoft Visual Studio:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% qmake -r ..\declarativewidgets.pro
% nmake (or jom)
% nmake install


The installation will be made into your Qt5 which means
you might need administrative powers (or sudo).
Choose the qmake associated with the Qt5 you want to install to.
